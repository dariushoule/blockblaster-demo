BlockBlaster C# Bootcamp Demo!
==============================

I'm open sourcing a small educational project used for beginners in C#, WebApi, XNA, and Unit Testing. This simple game/API was created for the purpose of facilitating a small presentation I gave at Tango Card in early 2014.

I was given the opportunity to help a team of very talented Java and PHP developers move to a new platform and language. This project served as a guide in a short series revolving around:

- A Kickstart in Visual Studio
- A Brief introduction into C# from a Java developer's perspective
- The MonoGame/XNA game programming framework
- ASP.NET and WebApi 
- LINQ and Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio
- Unit Testing [needs some revision]

The project itself is a videogame in which you are a small triangular spaceship shooting falling blocks. The sole game mechanic revolves around hitting smaller blocks as they are more challenging and reward more points. 

At the end of the game your score is submitted to a very simple web api designed to record and provide a list of high scores.
